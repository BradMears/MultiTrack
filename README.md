# MultiTrack - A repository of projects related to tracking things like satellites, balloons, and aircraft

The folders in this repo contain utilities, testbeds, and applications that use a Yaesu G-5500 Az/El rotator
to aim a directional antenna. Some of these are my very first attempts at controlling the rotator and others
build on what I learned.
